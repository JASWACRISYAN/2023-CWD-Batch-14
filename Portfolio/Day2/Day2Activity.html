            Anime (Japanese: アニメ, IPA: [aꜜɲime] i) is hand-drawn and
            computer-generated animation originating from Japan. Outside Japan and
            in English, anime refers specifically to animation produced in Japan.[1]
            However, in Japan and in Japanese, anime (a term derived from a
            shortening of the English word animation) describes all animated works,
            regardless of style or origin. Animation produced outside Japan with a
            similar style to Japanese animation is commonly referred to as
            anime-influenced animation.

                        Dragon Ball (Japanese: ドラゴンボール, Hepburn: Doragon Bōru) is a
                        Japanese media franchise created by Akira Toriyama in 1984. The
                        initial manga, written and illustrated by Toriyama, was serialized
                        in Weekly Shōnen Jump from 1984 to 1995, with the 519 individual
                        chapters collected into 42 tankōbon volumes by its publisher
                        Shueisha. Dragon Ball was originally inspired by the classical
                        16th-century Chinese novel Journey to the West, combined with
                        elements of Hong Kong martial arts films. Dragon Ball characters
                        also use a variety of East Asian martial arts styles, including
                        karate[1][2][3] and Wing Chun (kung fu).[2][3][4] The series
                        follows the adventures of protagonist Son Goku from his childhood
                        through adulthood as he trains in martial arts. He spends his
                        childhood far from civilization until he meets a teen girl named
                        Bulma, who encourages him to join her quest in exploring the world
                        in search of the seven orbs known as the Dragon Balls, which
                        summon a wish-granting dragon when gathered. Along his journey,
                        Goku makes several other friends, becomes a family man, discovers
                        his alien heritage, and battles a wide variety of villains, many
                        of whom also seek the Dragon Balls.
